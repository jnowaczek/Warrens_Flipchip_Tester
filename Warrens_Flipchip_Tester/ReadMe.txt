You need to use the NuGet package Manager to install the FTD2XX_NET package and create a reference to  dll.

You need to reinstall the driver for the USB serial port and use the FTDI VCP driver.
http://www.ftdichip.com

You need to put FTD2XX_NET.dll, libMPSSEWrapper.dll, and libMPSSE.dll files in the same directory as the executable.
I will make an installation package that will do this.

The DLLs from FTDI are not Managed Code. The C# language always uses managed code, so it requires a wrapper to hide the uglyness of using Non-Managed code from a Managed code language.
I found the original code for the wrapper here: https://github.com/DVDPT/libMPSSE-.Net-Wrapper
I modified the code by adding support for the MCP23S17 SPI GPIO part, and added FlipChip Tester specific Exceptions.

Two USB/SPI cables are available from FTDI. It shouldn't make a different which one you use.
	C232HM-DDHSL-0 supplies 3.3V, This is the one that I bought.
	C232HM-EDHSL-0 supplies 5.0V

The SPI cable works up to 10MHz with the MCP23S17 GOIP part.

Modifications to the original FlipChip Tester PCB for the USB/SPI interface:

	Add 10k pullup from IC5-18 (RESET-N) to Vdd.
	Cut A0(15), A1(16), A2(17) to RESET-N(18) traces for all 5x SPI chips.
	Jumper all 5x RESET-N(18) pins together.
		IC5-18 is already connected to PC1-4.

	These modifications set the SPI Hardware Addresses of each IC to match the IC number.
		Add 10k pullup from IC1-15 to Vdd.
		Add Ground to IC1-16, 17.
		Add 10k pullup from IC2-16 to Vdd.
		Add Ground to IC2-15, 17.
		Add 10k pullup from IC3-15, 16 to Vdd.
		Add Ground to IC3-17.
		Add 10k pullup from IC4-17 to Vdd.
		Add Ground to IC4-15, 16.
		Add 10k pullup from IC5-15, 17 to Vdd.
		Add Ground to IC5-16.

	Do not install IC6. This IC location can be used to jumper the SO and SI signals together.

	Connect SO at IC6-1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 11 together.
		SO will be on PC1-26

	Connect PC1-10, 12, 14, 16, 18 together.
		SI will be on all of these pins.

	USB SPI connections on connector PC1:
		Color	Pin Number	Name	Type			Description						Connector PC1
		Red		1			Vcc		Output			3.3V @ 250mA source				4 Used for the RESET-N pullup
		Orange	2	SCK		SK		Output			Serial Clock					8
		Yellow	3	MOSI	DO		Output			Serial Data output				10
		Green	4	MISO	DI		Input			Serial Data Input				26
		Brown	5	#CS		CS		Output			Serial Chip Select				6
		Gray	6			GPIOL0	Input/Output	General Purpose input/output
		Purple	7			GPIOL1	Input/Output	General Purpose input/output	
		White	8			GPIOL2	Input/Output	General Purpose input/output	
		Blue	9			GPIOL3	Input/Output	General Purpose input/output	
		Black	10			Gnd		Gnd				Device ground					25

		In the future I will connect one of the unused CS lines to the RESET-N signal.
		The tester seems to work OK without it.

Software implementation notes:

	Before you can use Hardware Adressing, you need to write 0x08 to the IOCON register.
	There is a bug in the MCP23S17 so you need to send the Hardware Address configuration to an address of 0x00 and 0x07.
	The SPI command is: 0x40 0x0a 0x08 0x08 and 0x4e 0x0a 0x08 0x08
